Designed for assistant-style interaction and visual reasoning, Scout uses 16 experts per forward pass and features a context length of 10 million tokens, with a training corpus of ~40 trillion tokens.\n\nBuilt for high efficiency and local or commercial deployment, Llama 4 Scout incorporates early fusion for seamless modality integration. It is instruction-tuned for use in multilingual chat, captioning, and image understanding tasks. Released under the Llama 4 Community License, it was last trained on data up to August 2024 and launched publicly on April 5, 2025.",
